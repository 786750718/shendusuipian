> [Project 1](../../../BlueJ 4.1.3/BlueJ projects/chapter01/figures/package.bluej) .bluej
>
> Exactly like how we create, manipulate and inspect agents in NetLogo

## Methods and Parameters

> [Project 1](../../../BlueJ 4.1.3/BlueJ projects/chapter01/figures/package.bluej) .bluej
>
> - inspect two objects to compare them side by side, exactly like what we did in NetLogo debug
>
> **Great feature of BlueJ** 
>
> - right click object in red (not Class in diagram) to check and run all their methods at your will
> - through dialogue window to offer inputs (for parameters, can be more than 1) to the methods

> **Project Features** 
>
> - bring a number of different classes together to create a new class, Picture
> - add a function or action to  `draw` function of Picture class
> - from inspect Picture (combined) object and further inspect its component objects 
> - take the first glance at the source code, see the structure of a class
> - learn to modify functions
